# Hangman-Game

Technologies used: HTML | CSS | Vanilla JS

Created a simple hangman game using Vanilla JS logic. 

Here's how the hangman game works: 

	* On page load, you will see a guess a letter box and blanks below the box. 

	* If you guess the letter correctly, then you will see the letter appear in one of the blanks and the number of tries remaining. 

	* If you guess the letter incorrectly, then you will not see any letter appear in the blanks but will still see the number of tries remaining. 

    * You have a total of 6 tries to guess the word. 

Enjoy!
